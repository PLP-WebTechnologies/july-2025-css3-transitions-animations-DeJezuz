# 🎬 CSS3 Transitions & Animations + JavaScript Integration

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the seamless integration of CSS3 transitions and keyframe animations with JavaScript logic to create an interactive, responsive web experience. It is structured in three parts:

1. **CSS3 Transitions & Animations** — Enhancing UI elements with smooth, visually engaging effects.
2. **JavaScript Functions** — Showcasing scope, parameters, and return values through reusable logic.
3. **CSS + JS Integration** — Dynamically triggering animations and DOM changes using JavaScript.

## 🎨 Part 1: CSS3 Transitions & Keyframes

- Button hover effects using `transition` and `transform`
- Animated box with dynamic scaling and rotation
- Modal popup with smooth fade and scale transitions

---

## 🧠 Part 2: JavaScript Functions

- Functions with parameters and return values (`calculateScale`, `toggleClass`)
- Scope demonstration using global and local variables
- Reusable logic for DOM manipulation and animation control

---

## 🔁 Part 3: CSS + JS Integration

- JavaScript triggers CSS animations by toggling classes
- Modal popup controlled via JS events
- Box animation activated on button click
